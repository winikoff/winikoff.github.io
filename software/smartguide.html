<p><b><font size=+2>NEW TRAM SET TO KICK BIG GOALS FOR MELBOURNE'S COMMUTERS</font></b></center>

<p>Melbourne's world famous trams welcomed a new addition to the family
today with the first M>Tram taking to the streets.
<p>In unveiling the new-look M>Tram, Transport Minister Peter Batchelor
detailed a multi-million dollar upgrade of Melbourne's tram fleet as part
of a service improvement program by transport operator National Express
Group.
<p>Key features of the program released today include:
<ul>
<li>
The refurbishment of 169 trams (114 Z-Class trams and 55 B-Class trams)</li>

<li>
The purchase of 59 new state of the art, easy access M>Trams from late
2002; and</li>

<li>
<font color="#FF0000">The pilot of a new electronic commuter information
and trip planning system which will appear throughout Melbourne over the
next few months.</font></li>
</ul>
In recognition of the important role trams play in Melbourne's culture,
M>Tram will also honour Melbourne as part of the refurbished trams by naming
the trams after our city's influential people and icons.
<p>National Express Group Australia CEO Craig Wallace revealed that the
first M>Tram would be named after former champion footballer Ron Barassi.
A number of other Victorian football legends will also be honoured in this
way, recognising the connection between the suburban roots of Melbourne's
football culture and the role trams play in that culture.
<p>The launch of M>Tram today follows last month's unveiling of the first
M>Train, paving the way for the rebranding of Swanston Trams and Bayside
Trains under the M> banner later this year.
<p>Just as demonstrated with the M>Train launch last month, the real benefits
go far beyond just a name change, Mr Wallace said.
<p>"As well as the 169 refurbished M>Trams starting to come into service,
there will be more staff in partnership with the Government and the trialing
of a significant new technology in the form of a trip planning and "real
time" passenger information system," Mr Wallace said.
<p>"But the improvements don't stop there. Next year we start to roll out
our brand new, low floor trams and high-tech trains which will put Melbourne's
tram and train fleet amongst the most advanced in the world", he added.
<p>These National Express initiatives form the next stage of the "M> Service
Improvement Program", designed to make tram and train travel more reliable,
more comfortable, more convenient and safer. Overall, National Express
will invest more than $100 million into Melbourne's public transport over
the next five years.
<p>"As a part of our Service Improvement Program we are conducting the
<font color="#FF0000">pilot program of an Australian first, our "<a href="http://www.smartguide.com.au">Smart
Guide</a>" passenger information system, designed by local company <A href="http://www.pixeltech.com.au">Pixeltech</a></font>,"
Mr Wallace said. "<font color="#FF0000">It is made up of two elements.
Firstly there is the real time passenger information display. It displays
the minutes until the next tram will reach the stop. It can display information
across a number of routes and even offers the option of audio announcements.</font>"
<p>"<font color="#FF0000">We are also unveiling an electronic trip planner.
Through its touch screen it allows commuters to simply select their desired
destination and receive all the information they need to get there, including
different modes of transport, the routes to take and the approx. time of
each journey. It is unique and offers a real benefit to all commuters.</font>
<p>"Melbourne has one of the most extensive tram networks in the world.
Melbournians love their trams but passengers have told us they want more
from the tram network, more safety, more convenience and more comfort.
<p>"That's what the M> Service Improvement Program is all about. It affects
every area of how we operate and serve our customers. It is a tangible
commitment on our behalf to deliver real benefits to passengers" Mr Wallace
said.
<p>Today's release of the first M>Tram marks the start of a refurbishment
program where 169 existing trams will all be given new exterior livery
and colours. As part of the refurbishments, the trams will be given a new
interior layout with improved fabric seat covers designed to stay cool
in hot weather, improved window blinds to allow vision while reducing heat
and glare, and high contrast tram step edging, handrails and straphangers.
<p>Newly refurbished M>Trams will appear regularly between now and 2003,
with the all new "low floor" trams to be introduced starting in late 2002.
