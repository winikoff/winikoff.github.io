<li><i>The Hollow Men</i>, Saturday 5th September 1998, The <a href="http://www.vicnet.net.au/~fdsinc/mcc.html">Melbourne Chamber Choir</a>, conducted by <a href="http://www.vicnet.net.au/~fdsinc/faye.htm">Faye Dumont</a>.A friend who attended the performance sent the following comment to the Australian choral-chat mailing list:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>I went along to the Melbo Chamber Choir (formerly Fay(e) Dumont Singe-ers) concert Satdy night - no! It had *nothing at all* to do with one of the basses! Nothing!</p>
<p>Anyway, they premiered Michael's "The Hollow Men" and all I can say is really puerile sounding stuff like "wow" and "wow" and maybe "wow"! It stayed with me for the past few days and was the most jaw-droppingly stunning thing I'd heard in a very long time indeed. Unfortunatement it wasn't recorded so if you missed it and didn't have a legit excuse like being out of the country or a previous engagement or you didn't know about it, then sucko to you with knobs on!</p>
<p>It was without doubt the standout piece of the evening and words fail me!</p>

<p>(from http://www.esc-basel.ch)</p>
<p>"<b>The Bells | With Bells Singing and Bells Ringing</b></p>
<p><i>A Project by Michel Uhlmann with Morgane Klein and The English Seminar Choir</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Friday, December 2, 2011, 8 pm - Offene Kirche Elisabethen Basel</li>
<li>Saturday, December 3, 2011, 8 pm - Kirche Baden</li>
</ul>
<p>This programme revolves around bells, with live compositions and performances by percussionist Morgane Klein in collaboration with the choir. Included are pieces about and with bells by Betsy Jolas and Maurizio Kagel as well as meditative moments with singing bowls and other cultic metal instruments. Especially for this project, the composer Michael Winikoff, New Zealand, will re-arrange his piece „Anthem for Doomed Youth“ for bells and choir. At the centre of the spectacle, new creations of sound are explored, with improvisation by the choir and the percussionist as well as elements of the English bell ringing tradition, which reaches far back in time. The programme is rounded off with pieces by Rachmaninov and Anne Boleyn as well as humoristic and satiric pieces like “Das Gl&auml;ut zu Speyer” by Ludwig Senfl. Throughout the concert, bells are understood as causing chaos and creating order, and measuring time, mourning and joy."</p>
