<p>My style is based on a variety of influences including early music and early twentieth century music and late romantic music.  It is mostly classical (as opposed to popular) and tonal.  I tend to use simple chords but often use non-standard sequences of harmonies.  Although there are some minimalistic tendencies I tend to go for "simplicity" in preference to extreme minimalism.  To me the <em>structure</em> of music is very important.  Music shouldn't ramble, it should be <em>cohesive</em>.  These days most of my work is choral. </p>
<p>My musical training began as a child with piano studies at the local conservatorium.  These were supplemented with theory and musicianship classes.  My first composition dates from 1982 (I was born in 1971 - you work it out).  In 1986 I moved to Australia where I continued studying piano and became active with music at school. Around this time I was also first introduced to choral music through singing at high school.  After finishing secondary school (and attaining an AmusA in piano), I went on to university and joined the <a href="http://www.mucs.aicsa.org.au"> Melbourne University Choral Society</a> in 1991, becoming its official accompanist the following year, a post I held until moving to the states in mid 1998. </p>
<p>In the intervening years I have conducted a chamber choir and have sung with the <a href="http://nyca.anca.org.au">Australian National Youth Choir</a>.  However, I am primarily known as an accompanist with strong sight reading and improvising skills. I have worked as accompanist with groups including the Australian boys choir, the Melbourne chorale, Faye Dumont's Melbourne women's choir and Melbourne master singers and a number of intervarsity choral festivals (IVCFs). I was principal accompanist for the  1997 IVCF in Perth and was involved in the organisation of the 1998 IVCF in Melbourne. </p>
<p>My first choral composition was Lament, written in 1994. It was premiered by the <a href="http://www.mucs.aicsa.org.au"> Melbourne university choral society</a> in October of that year and was also performed in November 1994 by the <a href="http://www.scuna.aicsa.org.au"> choral society of the Australian national university</a>. It has since been broadcast a number of times on 3MBS-FM and has won third place in the 1995 Boroondara eisteddfod. </p>
<p>I feel that music should be able to communicate something even at first hearing. In my work I try to remain accessible even though certain twentieth century idioms are used.  I feel that melody is an important element of music and shouldn't be thrown away in order to conform with certain prevalent twentieth century styles.   </p>
