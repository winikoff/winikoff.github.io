<h1>Michael Winikoff's Medleys</h1>
</header>

This page is an attempt to collate and capture my revue items. 
<p>
I am hoping to be able to get recordings (e.g. for 50IV) or create recordings.
Now that I have a MIDI keyboard I've started experimenting with recording MIDIs which works reasonably well. What's more fun is orchestrating the revue items - expect to see more of these!
<p>

I often prepare (or complete) my revue items at the last minute during the
festival.  This is intentional so I can include memorable themes from that
festival.  The performance is usually done from a short list of themes with
additional notes (e.g. keys, reminders about transitions).  In recent years
(starting with Nyevsky) I've started to prepare more sophisticated scores.  In
the case of Harry Potter the performance was from brief notes augmented with
handwritten music paper. The nice PDF was written after the festival.

<p>

Somewhat oddly, I have better records for stuff that I did 10 years than for
stuff that I did 3 years ago ... go figure.
(update: ironically, when updating this page I realised I didn't have the final
version of the Brisbane 2007 revue item!)

<p>

<font color=red><b>I am happy for members of the AICSA/IV community to copy
any of the material off this page, including MP3 files, as long as suitable attribution
is retained.</b></font>
<p>

Last, but certainly not least, I'd like to thank Rod Reynolds for his work in recording the IV revues, and for his permission to make the recordings available.

<h2>1996</h2>

Nameless (and pretty average) revue item at Canberra IV. 
Is used as part of soundtrack to video
 <a href="pdf/civ.pdf">PDF</a>

<h2>1997</h2>

No revue item at PIV (I was too busy being accompanist!)

<h2>1998</h2>

No revue item at MIV (I was too busy being on committee - and getting married!)

<h2>1999</h2>

After a year in West Virginia, came back with 
<i>Alexander Nyevsky's Ragtime Band</i>
which was performed at Hobert IV (50IV) and was one of my best revue items.
<a href="pdf/nyevsky.pdf">nyevsky.pdf</a>, <a href="pdf/nyevsky0.pdf">nyevsky0.pdf</a>

<p> NEW: recording courtesy of Rod Reynolds <a href="mp3/MW50IV.mp3">MP3</a>  
(Note: the recording ends abruptly before the piece finishes) <p>

Explanation: the previous IV (1998) performed works including <i>Alexander Nyevsky</i> and <i>Polovtsian Dances</i>, and also premierred Timothy Sexton's <i>Australian Alleluia</i>. The various American themes relate to the fact that Leanne and I had just returned from a year living in West Virginia. 

<h2>2000</h2>

I believe that I played a slightly revised version of Alexander Nyevsky at Brisbane IV (BIV2K)?

Blackadder; <a href="mp3/2005-rhapsody.mp3">MP3</a>).



<h2>2006</h2>
<!--- <img src="cup.jpg" align=right> --->

At my third(!) Adelaide IV I changed tack slightly, and instead of performing a
new piano piece, I instead "arranged" a choral piece: <i>Fanfare for the Common
Chorister</i>. Based, as the name suggests, on Copland's
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanfare_for_the_Common_Man"><i>Fanfare for
the Common Man</i></a>, this piece also featured a number of "guest appearances"
by John Williams, Howard Shore, Carl Orff and others.
It was performed by the Convergents, consisting of 
Bron,
David,
Emma,
Kate,
Leanne,
Mark,
myself, 
Michelle, 
Philip,
Sandra, and Woody; and won the award for the best revue item. 
(<A href="pdf/fanfare.pdf">PDF</a>, and another <a
href="pdf/fanfare-nocover.pdf">PDF</a> but without the cover page and smaller; also
<a href="mid/fanfare.mid">MIDI</a> and <a href="mp3/2006-fanfare-common.mp3">MP3</a>)

<p>
I also performed <i>Rhapsody in Red</i>. The performance
was dedicated to Bruce Alcorn. Way back in 1994, after I had performed <i>To
Boldly Go</i>, Bruce said something along the lines of "but you left out Red
Dwarf". This was the impetus for <i>Rhapsody in Red</i> which was first
performed later that year, at the 1994 Minifest in Melbourne. Although
<i>Rhapsody in Red</i> had been performed a number of times since then, Bruce
stopped attending IVs ... until 2006, which was the first time he heard the
piece (<a href="mp3/2006-rhapsody.mp3">MP3</a>) 
<p>
At some point after hearing <i>Rhapsody in Red</i> Bruce did comment that I
should look at <i>FireFly</i> ... hmmm ... stay tuned ... :-)
<p>

<h2>2007</h2>

I performed an item incorporating elements from Rachmaninov's 
<i>Liturgy of St John Chrysostom</i>, Orff's <i>Catulli Carmina</i> and
<i>Carmina Burana</i>...
as well as Queen's <i>Bohemian Rhapsody</i> and 
<i>Bananas in Pyjamas</i> (<A href="mp3/2007-biv.mp3">MP3</a>)

<pre>
Rachmaninov
Bohemian Rhapsody
Bananas in Pyjamas (slow and gentle)
Carmina (intro to bibit)
Bananas in Pyjamas (polka version)
Piramimma: energetic bit, then "pop" tune
... and when the saints
Catulli Carmina "miser catulus"
... slow bit of Catulli
Harry Potter (over Catulli chords)
Tocatta and Fugue
... Catulli ("odi")
... Carmina Burana ("semper crescis")
... Rachmaninov 
Back to Carmina Burana (second movement)
Finish with Carmina-style Gilligan
</pre>

<p>

<h2>2008</h2>

Unfortunately I was only able to be at Sydney IV 2008 for a few days.
If memory serves, I re-hashed <i>Rhapsody in Red</i>.
(<a href="mp3/2008-rhapsody.mp3">MP3</a>)
<p>

<h2>2009</h2>

I did not attend H1N1IV, err, I mean 60IV. 

<h2>2010</h2>

I performed a medley which was a bit of a remix of previous medleys. One thing
I noticed was that in some of my previous performances people started singing
along, but I would change to a different piece too soon. So this time I stayed
on certain pieces long enough to give people a chance to do some singing. <p>

Download: <a href="pdf/2010.pdf">PDF</a>, <a href="mp3/2010.mp3">MP3</a> <p>

Kate, Leanne, Bron and I also sang a serious medley combining three Beatles songs: 
Blackbird, Because, and Let it be. <p>

<h2>2011-2014</h2>

I did not attend IVs in 2011-2014 :-( <p>

<h2>2015</h2>

I performed a medley that consisted of a new medley (first half) based on the Verdi requiem ("Angry Verd-i Style"), and the second half being Harry Potter and the One Ring. <p>

Download: 
<a href="pdf/siv15.pdf">PDF</a> (first half - DRAFT), <a href="pdf/potter-siv15.pdf">PDF</a> (second half), and an <a href="mp3/siv15a.mp3">MP3</a> recording courtesy of Rob Reynolds - thanks! <p>

I also wrote a catch that was performed (<a href="pdf/siv15catch.pdf">PDF</a>) 
- thank you to Kate, Bron, Sandra, Alistair and Maya for joining me to perform it! <p> 

Finally, I also performed Rhapsody in Red, but not well - earlier performances (e.g. 2000) were better. <p>


<h2>2016</h2>

I performed a medley that combined a version of <i>To Boldly Go</i>, and <i>Rhapsody in Red</i> ...<p>

<h2>2017</h2>

I performed a tribute to a few of the many prominent people who had sadly died in 2016 (specifically: Alan Rickman, Leonard Cohen, David Bowie, and Carrie Fisher).

<h2>2018</h2>

A new medley titled <i>Game of Birds</i>, which combined the theme music from <i>Game of Thrones</i>, and <i>Angry Birds</i>, and also featured various other musical guests. My son suggested the initial idea, and helped with putting the piece together. Thanks Dragon!

<pre>

</pre>

<h2>2019</h2>

This was a collaboration with my son, Dragon, inspired by F&uuml;r Elise, which he was learning to play. It was designed with multiple opportunities for the audience to sing along<p>

<h2>2020-2024</h2>

There were no IVs due to COVID-19.<p>

<h2>2025</h2>

I did not attend <A href="https://www.siv.org.au">Sydney IV 2025</a>. <p>

<h2>2026</h2> 

I won't be attending <a href="https://civ.org.au">Canberra IV 2026.</a> <p>

<h2>2027 and beyond</h2>

Who knows? Stay tuned. <p>
