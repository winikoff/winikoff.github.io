<h1>Kia ora! Hello!</h1>

<p>I am a Professor (and was Head of School) in the <a href="http://vuw.ac.nz/sim">School of Information Management</a>, at <a href="http://vuw.ac.nz">Victoria University of Wellington</a>, in Aotearoa / New Zealand.</p>
<p>Previously, I was at the <a href="http://www.otago.ac.nz">University of Otago</a> in the Department of Information Science. I joined that department in September 2009. Earlier in 2009 (since September 2008) I worked at Otago's Higher<a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/hedc/index.html"> Education Development Centre</a>, and before that was Associate Professor at RMIT University's School of Computer Science and IT.</p>
<p>I'm on <a href="https://mastodon.nz/@profwinikoff" rel="me">Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/profwinikoff.bsky.social">BlueSky</a>.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>The overall aim of my research is to find better ways of creating software. I am interested in (agent oriented) software engineering, programming languages, and logic and formal methods.</p>
<p>Over the past two and a half decades I have focussed on software that is conceptualised in terms of "<em>intelligent agents</em>" which are able to exhibit robust and flexible behaviour. I am perhaps best known for my work on design methodologies for agent-based systems, in particular the <em>Prometheus</em> methodology.</p>
<p>More recently I have been looking at societal consequences of autonomous systems, and the <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-to-make-robots-that-we-can-trust-79525">issues that affect trust in these systems</a>, and have worked on making autonomous systems more explainable.</p>
<p>My <a href="http://www.oakland.edu/enp/">Erd&#337;s number</a> is <a href="erdos-number/">3</a>. See also my <a href="http://scholar.google.co.nz/citations?user=oOebTpIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">google scholar entry</a> and my <a href="https://dblp.org/pid/w/MichaelWinikoff.html">DBLP page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>You can find on this site a <a href="publications">list of publications</a>.</strong></p>
<h2>Leadership &amp; Service</h2>
<p>I am Past President of the <a href="https://www.ifaamas.org/">International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (IFAAMAS)</a>, co-Editor-in-Chief of the <a href="https://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/10458">Journal of Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (JAAMAS)</a>, and chair of the <a href="https://www.core.edu.au/icore-portal">ICORE rankings management committee</a>. I am also on the steering committee for the <a href="http://emas.in.tu-clausthal.de/">EMAS workshop series</a>, and am on various (senior) programme committees.</p>
<p>Previously I was Editor-in-Chief for the <a href="http://www.inderscience.com/jhome.php?jcode=IJAOSE">International Journal of Agent-Oriented Software Engineering (IJAOSE)</a>, Vice President of the <a href="http://www.core.edu.au">Computing Research and Education Association of Australasia (CORE)</a>, was on the 2018 PBRF MIST panel, and was general co-chair for <a href="https://www.ifaamas.org/AAMAS/aamas2017/">AAMAS 2017</a> and program co-chair for <a href="https://www.ifaamas.org/AAMAS/aamas2012/">AAMAS 2012</a>. I was head ("chairperson") of the department of Information Science (February 2011 - December 2016) and Head of School of the <a href="https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/sim">School of Information Management</a> (February 2021 - February 2025).</p>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>I have written a range of software including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210201073734/http://waitaki.otago.ac.nz/%7Emichael/wp/index.html">W-Prolog</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201130061952/http://www.cs.rmit.edu.au/lygon/">Lygon</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210201073745/http://waitaki.otago.ac.nz/%7Emichael/auml/index.html">auml.pl</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210201073755/http://waitaki.otago.ac.nz/%7Emichael/smartguide.html">SmartGuide</a>, and a range of palm pilot software including <a href="http://www.aldweb.com/pages/winikoff/Karel/index.html">Karel the robot</a>.</p>
<h2>Non-work</h2>
<p>When not working, I enjoy being with my wife, <a href="https://people.wgtn.ac.nz/julija.sardelic">Julija</a>, and children. I also enjoy playing board games, reading, and watching sci-fi. Finally, I am a keen musician: I play piano, sing in (and sometimes conduct) choirs, and also <strong><a href="http://winikoffmusic.wordpress.com">compose</a></strong>.</p>
